    <string name="help_text">Enter a prompt for the AI Poet to generate a poem about, or
        use one of the prompts provided using the shuffle button.\n\n
        The longer the prompt the better, as it gives the AI more context about what you want to
        convey.\n\n
        Then, click the generate button and the AI Poet will generate a poem from your prompt.\n\n
        You can then choose to continue generating the poem, share the poem, or give the AI Poet a
        new prompt.\n\n
        Each generated poem is automatically saved to your device, and can be read on the Saved
        Poems page. \n\n
        You can also use the Change Poet screen to change the appearance of your AI Poet.
